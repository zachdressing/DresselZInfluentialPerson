//Make a responsive (mobile/desktop) website using Tailwind about an influential person.

//Review: I liked the website and the facts about Kyle Hill were definitely interesting, I liked seeing who he's met on the home page. The only thing about it that can't really be helped is that when I loaded the page it looked a bit off but that's just beacuse of my screen size. Also, tailwind breaks for a second when you change pages on the mobile size which can't be helped either. Overall it's a very
clean website that functions as it should, good work!
